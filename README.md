# Cloaked
"Cloaked" is an Android application which allows users to use LSB-based image steganography to encode their secret messages inside a carrier/cover image along with a password, thus adding an added layer of security. Using steganalysis, the receiver in possession of the correct password will be able to decode the transmitted steganographic image and retrieve the hidden secret message. JPEG and PNG image file formats are supported in this application as they are two of the most widely used image file formats that also work well with LSB coding.

Here are a few screenshots to demonstrate how the app works:
