# Cloaked
Cloaked is an Android app that implements steganography and steganalysis for users to communicate sensitive data through carrier images. LSB coding algorithm has been used.
Users can also give a password to add an additional layer of security to their data. Only users who enter the correct password of the uploaded encoded image can perform 
decoding and extract the hidden message.
