    <string name="faq_label">FAQs</string>

    <string name="faq_q1">Q1. What is the major use of this application?</string>

    <string name="faq_a1">A1. This application implements steganography which allows users to hide
        their private data inside images without the fear of detection. Only authorized people can
        access the decoded data from the encoded images after password verification.</string>

    <string name="faq_q2">Q2. Is my data secured?</string>

    <string name="faq_a2">A2. The algorithm for steganography implemented in this application ensures
        that the final encoded image contains imperceptible changes so that the existence of a
        hidden message is not detectable by anyone except the user. The user can use a password to
        encode the secret message so that she/he can allow only authorized recipients to access the
        hidden data by verifying the password.</string>

    <string name="faq_q3">Q3. Is there any limitation on usage?</string>

    <string name="faq_a3">A3. This application has been made to meet the satisfaction of the
        customers. There are no bounds on the limits of usage.</string>
